# Weather-API

It takes the location, n 0-5 and t time - 00:00 - 21:00 at a difference of 3:00 as input and has various functions such as get temperature, get sea level, get pressure which basically returns the predicted weather from the current day + n day and at t time.

# Setup

clone the repository

` git clone `

It requires urllib to run therefore to install urllib

`pip install urllib`

Then, it should be good to go but be sure to edit the input in the file before execution otherwise it'd run on the default input and probably no output would be shown as it does not contain any print statements.

`python weatherAPI.py`
